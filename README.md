**Face Mask Detection**

*Detect faces and determine whether they are wearing mask.*

Firstly, I hope the people in the world defeat COVID as soon as possible. Stay strong!!

To help the government and regulatory organizations manage the people's compliance with wearing masks. I built a model to recognize people wearing mask or not.

â˜‘ Pytorch

â˜‘ OpenCV dnn

The Resnet 50 Architecture provided by Pytorch was used in this project.

* Accuracy:

*The model can recognize the object covering in front of your face, and not consider it as a mask. While other facemask models I found on git can't do this ðŸ˜ƒ.*
